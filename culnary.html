                <h3>WELCOME TO THE CULINARY DEPARTMENT</h3>
                <p>The Culinary Arts/Professional Baking Program provides students with the necessary skills and certifications that are needed to enter into the food industry at a proficient level. </p>
                <p>
                    This summer (2022) we had 14 students enrolled, the Professional Cooking Basics students tackled the challenge of making a Navajo Taco healthy. During the course of the program, they learned about safety and sanitation, chicken fabrication, and vegetable and starch cookery. During the last week of class, they focused on making frybread as healthy as possible and how to substitute ground beef with healthier proteins and one team even went the vegan route. Lastly, they had to tackle how to cook for a large crowd of people versus just their family. The students were awesome and showed up every day ready to work and learn. I was able to recruit one student for the cooking program with the hopes of a few more upon graduation. We have a goal of getting 15 students enrolled for summer 2023.</p>

                   <h3>Instructor's Testimonial</h3>
                   <p>I grew up in my grandparents' restaurant which was one of the oldest restaurants in the state. I entered culinary school a little late in life at 30 and have not looked back since. Attending culinary school helped to ignite my passion for food, food knowledge, and history. I've been a teacher at NTU for over 12 years now and have enjoyed it immensely. Teaching the summer STEM Professional Cooking Basics is one of my more favorite classes to teach. The students love to come to class every day, usually in hopes of getting to eat but learn a great deal during our time together. <br><br>

                    I teach bachelor's classes, which include classes like financial analysis, hospitality law, and HR management. I also help with curriculum development, coach the American Culinary Federation student team, and various other things that keep me very busy.
